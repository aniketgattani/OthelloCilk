Files:

  interactive: 
    a command that you can source to get a command line prompt
    in the interactive partition on a compute node

    usage:

      source interactive


  reservation: 
    a command that you can source to get a command line prompt
    in the interactive partition on a compute node. unlike the
    command above, this one uses the comp 422/534 course reservation.

    usage:

      source reservation

  submit.sbatch:
    a script that you can use to launch a batch job that will execute 
    a series of tests on 1..16 cores on a compute node. currently, this
    submission file is configured to use the reserved nodes in the
    interactive partition. you might get faster turnaround time with 
    either the scavenge or commons partitions. 

    you can modify this script to run your code multiple times with different lookahead depths
    using cilkview to collect scalability and performance metrics.

    usage:
        sbatch < submit.sbatch

  othello.cpp: 
    a program that you can use as the basis for your code if you wish.  
    your solution may include any or all of the code in this file. 

  Makefile:
    a Makefile that includes recipes for building and running your program

    usage:

      make # builds your code
      make runp # runs a parallel version of your code on W workers
      make runs # runs a serial version of your code on one worker
      make screen # runs your parallel code with cilkscreen
      make view # runs your parallel code with cilkview
      make runp-hpc # runs hpctoolkit with the options -e REALTIME@1000 -t
      

Contents:
  * othello.cpp - main program that runs othello game
  * cilkscreen.out - contains cilkscreen ouput of the othello program with search depth 4
  * cilkviews/ - directory containing all the cilkview outputs from search depth 1-7
  * slurm_ouputs/ -  directory containing runtime ouput of the program when run on NOTS compute nodes. Each file is first run with serial code then we increment threads per execution for parallel flow
  * othello.m & othello.d & othello.hpcstruct - directories & files containing HPCToolkit database
  * cilk_ouput.batch - batch file that creates the cilkscreen.out for depth = 4  & cilkviews/ files for depths 1-7 as mentioned above
  * default_inputs - directory containing all the inputs for search depth 1-7
  * Othello Report - Report pdf for the assignment.
